            <td>This theme took inspiration from the monochromatic color scheme. All the colors are very similar so you get that monotone feeling
                from it. But with the last three being lighter you still get a nice pop from the dark blue. I think this theme could be useful for
                someone who wants a more calming effect to their website or a site advertising night time activities like camping or a drive-in
                theater</td>

            <td><img src="images/color-theory/beach-sunset.png" alt="Beach Sunset Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>For the Beach Sunset theme I tried to use the complementary scheme though it might be considered a bit of spilt as well. The blue
                and orange are opposite each other so should work well with making the other color pop. The pale yellow I added to resemble the
                sun and sand and to expand the color theme a bit more. Just from the name clearly these colors might work well for a website
                promoting tropical vacations</td>

            <td><img src="images/color-theory/cherryblossom.png" alt="Cherry Blossom Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>I partly made this theme because I love cherry blossoms and to show off the analogous scheme. Although it could be considered a
                bit monochromatic as well. While the pinks aren't on a basic color wheel the fact they are all near each other on a complex wheel
                makes it analogous. For this theme I think someone who wants a more feminine look or maybe someone who sells flowers could like
                all the pinks for their site</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Halloween</td>
            <td><img src="images/color-theory/halloween.png" alt="Halloween Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>The Halloween theme took slight influence from the <br>
                 split scheme. While not fully accurate because the <br>
                 purple isn't being used as the base, it still uses <br>
                 the orange and yellow that are to the side of the <br>
                 color opposite it. Obviously this theme would be <br>
                 great for a website that's Halloween related. Like <br>
                 one selling costumes or pumpkins or even promoting <br>
                 haunted houses</td>

            <td>Pastel Spring</td>
            <td><img src="images/color-theory/pastel-spring.png" alt="Pastel Spring Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>For this theme I tried to make one that kinda used <br>
                the triadic scheme. Because of the pastel approach <br>
                I took, I had to just use a tint of red which is why <br>
                one is pink and the white I added to expand the palette <br>
                some. The pastel look makes me think this theme might <br>
                work well with a website that caters to babies or <br>
                younger kids so like a daycare service or elementary <br>
                school</td>
