            <td>Moonlight</td>
            <td><img src="images/color-theory/moonlight.png" alt="Moonlight Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>This theme took inspiration from the monochromatic <br>
                color scheme. All the colors are very similar so <br>
                you get that monotone feeling from it. But with <br>
                the last three being lighter you still get a nice <br>
                pop from the dark blue. I think this theme could be <br>
                useful for someone who wants a more calming effect <br>
                to their website or a site advertising night time <br>
                activities like camping or a drive-in theater</td>

            <td><img src="images/color-theory/beach-sunset.png" alt="Beach Sunset Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>For the Beach Sunset theme I tried to use the <br>
                complementary scheme though it might be considered <br>
                a bit of spilt as well. The blue and orange are <br>
                opposite each other so should work well with making <br>
                the other color pop. The pale yellow I added to <br>
                resemble the sun and sand and to expand the color <br>
                theme a bit more. Just from the name clearly these <br>
                colors might work well for a website promoting <br>
                tropical vacations</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cherry Blossom</td>
            <td><img src="images/color-theory/cherryblossom.png" alt="Cherry Blossom Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>I partly made this theme because I love cherry <br>
                blossoms and to show off the analogous scheme. <br>
                Although it could be considered a bit monochromatic <br>
                as well. While the pinks aren't on a basic color <br>
                wheel the fact they are all near each other on <br>
                a complex wheel makes it analogous. For this <br>
                theme I think someone who wants a more feminine <br>
                look or maybe someone who sells flowers could <br>
                like all the pinks for their site</td>

            <td>Halloween</td>
            <td><img src="images/color-theory/halloween.png" alt="Halloween Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>The Halloween theme took slight influence from the <br>
                 split scheme. While not fully accurate because the <br>
                 purple isn't being used as the base, it still uses <br>
                 the orange and yellow that are to the side of the <br>
                 color opposite it. Obviously this theme would be <br>
                 great for a website that's Halloween related. Like <br>
                 one selling costumes or pumpkins or even promoting <br>
                 haunted houses</td>

            <td><img src="images/color-theory/pastel-spring.png" alt="Pastel Spring Theme" height="265" width="260"></td>
            <td>For this theme I tried to make one that kinda used <br>
                the triadic scheme. Because of the pastel approach <br>
                I took, I had to just use a tint of red which is why <br>
                one is pink and the white I added to expand the palette <br>
                some. The pastel look makes me think this theme might <br>
                work well with a website that caters to babies or <br>
                younger kids so like a daycare service or elementary <br>
                school</td>
