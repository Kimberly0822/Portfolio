    <p>In this project I had to make a video game title screen. I decided on a flying witch and her cat as a way to show my ability
      to animate things. With that decided I looked up ideas and found a cute picture someone drew of Kiki's Delivery Service and
      decided to base my title screen off it. It took quite some time to draw but with it finished I added a witch hat on top of the
      cat for extra cuteness and got to work animating!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fluid Brush, Smoothen, and Odject Drawing Mode
        <ul>
          <li>With the brush I was able to do all the drawing for the witch and cat on her broom plus the clouds. Then I went to
            properties and used the smoothing effect to smooth out my shakey lines. Only thing is this can sometimes make the lines
            wonky so I then went into odject drawing mode to adjust them to my liking</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Classic and Motion Tween
        <ul>
          <li>I used the classic tween to create the fade in effect on the words and then the motion tween on the text, birds, and girl
            to make them move</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Onion Skinning and Movie Clip
        <ul>
          <li>These tools helped me to create the bird. First I found a set of pictures of a simple bird in each frame of flying. I
            took the first pose and made it into a movie clip so I could then go in and add more poses on the inside. This is where
            the onion skinning helped. It helped me to line up the previous pose so the flying would look smooth and not like it's
            jumping around. With all the poses in their set frame the bird was complete!</li>
        </ul>
