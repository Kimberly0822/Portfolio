    <h1>Designing a Webpage</h1>
    <p>Designing a website can be difficult. There's so many rules to follow and you have to balance between being innovative and pushing the
    boundaries but not going overboard. It can be a struggle to find that balance and what most people seem to forget when trying to be
    different is that oftentimes less is more. The website pictured below by <a href="https://lifeactionrevival.org/">lifeactionrevival</a>
    is one such site. There's content on top of content so you can't even see the information underneath. There's almost no use of white
    space so it all feels cluttered until you scroll down and it's just all whitespace for a very long time. Also besides the pictures
    there's no color besides the one yellow box that makes it hard to read the links inside. The whole site just feels overwhelming and
    boring with its overlapping content, broken code, and lack of a color scheme</p>

    <p>Even though there's many unappealing websites out there, there's many that are amazing as well. One of my favorite sites to look
    at and explore is the site for <a href="https://nasaprospect.com/">Nasa Prospect</a>. While the beginning might not look like much
    once you scroll down is when you finally get into the amazing design. To start, NasaProspect made sure to use white for the text on
    the dark starry background so everything would be visable and easy to read. Then as you scroll you read about the story of an
    astronaut in space going on their own little adventure. Each section is short to be able to hold even a child's attention span and
    with the visuals moving and changing as you scroll it makes you wanna keep exploring the page. Any dialogue is colored in a pale
    yellow or blue to help give them more emphasis and change up the monotone color scheme of the black and white. It's a very beautiful
    and engaging site and I encourage anyone interested in wed design to take a look</p>
