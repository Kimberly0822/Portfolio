    <h5 class="passionate">Designing a Webpage</h5>
    <img src="images/color-theory/lifeaction.png" class="revival" alt="lifeactionrevival site">
    <p>Designing a website can be difficult. There's so many rules to follow and you have to balance between being innovative and pushing the
    boundaries but not going overboard. It can be a struggle to find that balance and what most people seem to forget when trying to be
    different is that oftentimes less is more. The website pictured below by <a href="https://lifeactionrevival.org/" target="newtab">lifeactionrevival</a>
    is one such site. There's content on top of content so you can't even see the pictures and information underneath. There's almost no
    use of white space so it all feels cluttered until you scroll down and it's just all whitespace for a very long time. Also besides
    the pictures there's no color besides the one yellow box that makes it hard to read the links inside. The whole site just feels
    overwhelming and boring at the same time with its overlapping content, broken code, and lack of a color scheme</p>
    <p>Even though there's many unappealing websites out there, there's many that are amazing as well. One of my favorite sites to look
        <img src="images/color-theory/astronaut.png" class="astronaut" alt="Nasa Prospect Site">
    at and explore is the site for <a href="https://nasaprospect.com/" target="newtab">Nasa Prospect</a>. While the beginning might not
    look like much once you scroll down is when you finally get into the amazing design. To start, Nasa Prospect made sure to use white
    for the text on the dark starry background so everything would be visable and easy to read. Then, as you scroll, you read about the
    story of an astronaut in space going on their own little adventure. Each section is short to be able to hold even a young kid's
    attention span and with the visuals moving and changing as you scroll it makes you wanna keep exploring the page. Any dialogue is
    colored in a pale blue or yellow to help give them more emphasis and adds a bit of flair to the monotone color scheme of black and
    white. It's a very beautiful and engaging site and I encourage anyone interested in wed design or even space to take a look</p>
