    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>Many think typography is just choosing a font that looks nice but it's much more than that. It's the art and technique of
        arranging your text to be legible, readable and appealing to the user. While just choosing a typeface is the bulk of this
        there are many other things that can aid you in your endeavor to make an attractive and legiable site. Some things you can do
        is change the point size, line length, line spacing, letter spacing, or the spaces between pairs of letters. As you can see
        typography is much more complex than most think so let's get into some basic terms that might help you on your journey</p>
    <h2>Typeface vs Font</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Typeface
            <ul>
                <li>As it turns out many confuse the word typeface for the word font and I was one of those people. Typeface is really
                    just what people thought font was. It's a set of design features or in other words the style the letters and other
                    characters take when used</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Font
            <ul>
                <li>So now we have a bit of a dilemma. If font isn't what we thought it was, what exactly is font? To put it simply, font
                    is basically a subset of a typeface. When you choose a typeface it can have different sizes or styles or weights. Such
                    as being italicized or bold, point 18 or point 24. Each of these different versions is called a font</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h2>The Different Typefaces</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Serif
            <ul>
                <li>The serif typeface is more traditional in appearance and can be distinguished from other by small decorative lines, or
                    "feet", that extend out from the ends of characters. Serif is used particularymuseful in printed and text heavy writings
                    for its readability and for how it aids the reader's eyes along the lines of text</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/typography-pics/serif.png" alt="Serif Typefaces" height="160" width="280">
        <li>Sans-Serif
            <ul>
                <li>The sans-serif typeface is identified by its clean and unadorned look. So unlike the serif tpyefaces there are no "feet"
                    on the characters. Sans-serif offers a more simple and clean look so is widely used in digital media but because of its
                    high versatility they are quite useful in print as well</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/typography-pics/sans-serif.png" alt="Sans-Serif Typefaces" height="180" width="250">
        <li>Script
            <ul>
                <li>Script typeface tends to mimic the fluidity of calligraphy with connected characters and looping strokes. Because of this
                    they are more often used for more formal things like invitations. However even though script looks nice they aren't very
                    suited for body text because the many swooping lines can make it difficult to read</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/typography-pics/script.png" alt="Script Typefaces" height="170" width="260">
        <li>Monospaced
            <ul>
                <li>Monospaced characters all occupy the same horizontal
                    space. Often used in typewriters and coding these
                    typefaces ensure uniformity making them great for jobs
                    where text alignment is important</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/typography-pics/monospace.png" alt="Monospace Typefaces" height="150" width="300">
        <li>Handwritten
            <ul>
                <li>Handwritten is similar to script where many have swooping lines but it often adds the slight imperfections a person's
                    hand might give text. This typeface is useful for when you wanna add a more personal touch to whatever it is you're
                    making. But like with script because of it's intricate nature it isn't great for body text as it's legibilty decreases</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/typography-pics/handwritten.png" alt="Handwritten Typefaces" height="170" width="370">
        <li>Decorative
            <ul>
                <li>Decorative, or display typefaces, are fun eye catching typefaces that can range from playful or witty to futuristic 
                    or maybe even nostalgic. These are great as attention grabbers for use as logos or special text in advertisments.
                    While fun their use should be limited so as not to distract and impact user readability</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Layout Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Single Column
            <ul>
                <li>Single column is the basic layout that most webpages use. The text goes straight across the screen from left to right
                    and is the simplist design to employ</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Multi Column
            <ul>
                <li>Often used by newspapers and brochures a multi column layout is great for breaking up a ton of short bits of
                    information. Some of the benefits is that it will make the text look less daunting to read and make it easier
                    to scan the many headlines</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
