    <h1>Color Theory</h1>
    <p>Color theory is the art and science of how color works together and how they can effect our emotions when viewed. While most
        might think choosing a color for a project is an arbitrary thing and the designers' choice it is also good practice to keep in
        mind the rules of color theory. Choosing colors just because they're your favorite doesn't always mean it'll translate to a
        cohesive and legiable site. To start I'll list some of the basic terms that are good to remember</p>
    <h2>The Colors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These are the basic colors and cannot be made by mixing
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Red, Yellow, Blue</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Secondary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These colors are made by mixing together 2 of the primary colors
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Purple, Green, Orange</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tertiary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These colors can be made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Bluish-Green, Redish-Orange, Bluish-Purple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <h2>Changing Color Pigment</h2>
        <li>Hue
            <ul>
            <li>Hue refers to the specific color family of the color that we're looking at. Bascially the origin, or underlying, color.
                So the hue will usually be one of the primary or secondary colors
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember black, white, and gray are not considered hues</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shades
            <ul>
            <li>Shades are made by mixing a hue with black to get those darker or more dull colors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tints
            <ul>
            <li>Tints are created by mixing a hue with white which will give you those lighteror more pastel colors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tones
            <ul>
            <li>Tones are made by mixing together a hue with gray which can give you that middle ground between a shade and tint</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
