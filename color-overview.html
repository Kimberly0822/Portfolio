    <h1>Color Theory</h1>
    <p>Color theory is the art and science of how color works together and how they can effect our emotions when viewed. While most
        might think choosing a color for a project is an arbitrary thing and the designers' choice it is also good practice to keep in
        mind the rules of color theory. Choosing colors just because they're your favorite doesn't always mean it'll translate to a
        cohesive and legiable site. To start I'll list some of the basic terms that are good to remember</p>

    <h2>Types of Colors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Color Wheel
            <ul>
            <li>The color wheel is a very important tool in color theory that helps you see the relationships between colors. I've
                posted an example of one above
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Red, Yellow, Blue</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Primary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These are the basic colors and cannot be made by mixing
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Red, Yellow, Blue</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Secondary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These colors are made by mixing together two of the primary colors
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Purple, Green, Orange</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tertiary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These colors can be made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Blue-Green, Red-Orange, Blue-Purple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Quanternary Colors
            <ul>
            <li>Quanternary colors are made when you mix two tertiary colors together
                <ul>
                    <li>These colors are more complex so they aren't on the basic wheel up above but some examples are rust
                        (orange and purple), slate (purple and green), and citron (green and orange)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cool Colors
            <ul>
            <li>These colors often give a peaceful or soothing vibe when used in a project
                <ul>
                    <li>Blues is what you often think of when you hear cool colors but some purples, greens, and pinks fit into the
                        category as well</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/cool.png" alt="Cool Colors" height="60" width="220">
        <li>Warm Colors
            <ul>
            <li>Warm colors often give energy and excitment to a project
                <ul>
                    <li>Red is what people tend to think of when hearing warm colors but yellow and orange are considered warm as well</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/warm.png" alt="Warm Colors" height="60" width="220">
        <li>Neutral Colors
            <ul>
            <li>Neutral colors are often thought of as the abscence of color like white or gray but some will have the faintest bit of
                color to them</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/neutrals.png" alt="Neutrals" height="60" width="220">
    </ul>
    <h2>Differences in Color</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hue
            <ul>
            <li>Hue refers to the specific color family of the color that we're looking at. Bascially the origin, or underlying,
                color which will usually be one of the primary or secondary colors. So colors like sky blue, dark blue, navy blue
                are all hues of blue
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember black, white, and gray are not considered hues</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shades
            <ul>
            <li>Shades are made by mixing a hue with black to get those darker colors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/shades.png" alt="Shades" height="60" width="220">
        <li>Tints
            <ul>
            <li>Tints are created by mixing a hue with white which will give you those lighter more pastel colors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/tints.png" alt="Tints" height="60" width="220">
        <li>Tones
            <ul>
            <li>Tones are made by mixing together a hue with gray which can give you that middle ground between a shade and tint
                which make the colors look more dull and muddy in appearance</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/tones.png" alt="Tones" height="60" width="220">
        <li>Saturation
            <ul>
            <li>The intensity or purity of a hue. In other words, it measures how vivid, deep, or vibrant a color is. A highly saturated
                color appears rich and bold, while less saturation may make them appear washed out or dull</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Value
            <ul>
            <li>Refers to the lightness or darkness of a color and defines a color in terms of how close it is to white or black
                <ul>
                    <li>The higher the value the closer the color gets to white and the lower the value the closer it is to black</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Contrast
            <ul>
            <li>Contrast really just means the difference of something and when used in color theory, the differences in the hues used.
                Contrast is great for drawing the viewers eye to a specific point
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: If you have mainly neutral colors on your website, wall, etc and decide to add a bright red to it, the eyes
                        will be drawn to that one spot because it's so different from everything else</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Complementary
            <ul>
            <li>Colors that are opposite on the color wheel. This scheme is usually used by picking a dominant color and an accent
                color but using both equally works as well. You can also add neutrals to increase the variety
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Blue and Orange, Green and Red, Red-Purple and Yellow-Green</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/complementary.png" alt="Complementary Scheme" height="210" width="210">
        <li>Triadic
            <ul>
            <li>Triadic colors are evenly spaced apart on the color wheel. This scheme tends to choose one dominant and then the other
                two are accents
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Purple, Green, Orange or Blue-Purple, Yellow-Green, Red-Orange</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/triadic.png" alt="Triadic Scheme" height="210" width="210">
        <li>Split
            <ul>
            <li>A split scheme chooses the base color and then uses the two colors to the side of the color opposite from the base.
                Like with triadic this scheme uses the base color choosen as the dominant and then the other two as accents
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Purple as the base and Yellow-Green and Yellow-Orange as accents or Blue-Green as the base and Red and
                        Orange as accents</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/split.png" alt="Split Scheme" height="210" width="210">
        <li>Analogous
            <ul>
            <li>This scheme uses colors that share the same space on the wheel. So colors that are right next to each other. Using this
                kind of scheme gives a very monotone feeling from the lack of contrast and is easy to apply since the colors match
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Blue, Blue-Green, Green or Red-Orange, Red, Red-Purple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/color-theory/analogous.png" alt="Analogous Scheme" height="210" width="210">
        <li>Monochromatic
            <ul>
            <li>Monochromatic uses one color with its various shade, tone, and tint counter parts to create a scheme. One might even add
                full black or white to add some depth
                <ul>
                    <li>These colors aren't on the wheel above but some colors you might use to create a monochromatic scheme might be
                        navy blue, cobalt, azure, and denim</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
