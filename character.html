  <section id="Description">
    <p>In this project I tried to animate a character doing a simple motion. In my class one of our exercises was to create a character. I decided I wanted to base it off of my dnd character who is a fire genasi with ombre flame like hair and glowing tattoos along her body. Her weapon of choice is knives which is why I animated her throwing one. I'm not super artistic so making armor seemed like a bit much for me and just put her in modern clothes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shape Tools, Blur Tool, and Object Drawing Mode
        <ul>
          <li>With these I was able to create the character, sun, and grass. The eye, head, body, and etc are all shapes and any
            curves that make an unnatural shape are made by going into object drawing mode and adjusting the line. The blur tool I
            only used on the sun to make it seem like it was shining from the corner instead of having just a solid circle</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fluid Brush
        <ul>
          <li>I used this brush to draw the tattoos, tree, and knife</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Gradient Tool
        <ul>
          <li>The gradient tool allowed me to make the ombre effect on the hair and tattoos. I went into the color palette and created
            my own custom gradient and then added it where I wanted the gradient look</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Motion Tween and Bone Tool
        <ul>
          <li>Used to animate everything. To be able to make the arms move I had to make each body part and symbol which then let me
            add the bone tool to it. I could then move the arms or legs as if the drawing had actual joints instead of drawing each
            frame. Then with the motion tool I made the arms and knife move where I wanted them to go and animste helped fill in the
            blanks</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
