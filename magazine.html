    <p>For this project I tried to make a magazine cover with a fake celebrity. The hardest part of it was trying to pick out fonts
      and figuring out the right placement for the text but even through all the difficulties I feel it turned out well! Some of the many tools I used for this project were...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The selection and masking tools
        <ul>
          <li>With these tools I was able to select the woman and hide the background of her picture so you'd be able to see the
            background I wanted to use</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Opacity and Gaussian Blur
        <ul>
          <li>I used these to lower the opacity of the picture and add a slight blur to it to take away focus from the background and
            instead go more to the text</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Curves
        <ul>
          <li>I used the curves adjustment layer since it gives me a bit more control over the brightness. With it I lessened the
            brightness of both the woman and the background since they seemed a bit washed out</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Stroke and Gradient Overlay
        <ul>
          <li>I wanted the colors of the magazine to all kinda match each other but the problem with that was they'd often blend into
            the background and make it hard to read. But with the stroke tool I added either a darker or lighter border to help the
            words pop for. As for the gradient tool I used it on some of the text to make it fancier and to stand out</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
