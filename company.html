  <section id="Description">
    <p>For this project I put my drawing skills to the test. I was to make a logo, ad, and business card for a fake company. One of my
      favorite flowers are cherry blossoms and I love ramen so much. So I thought "Why not use those to make my project?" And now you
      can see the results of all my hard work! I hope you enjoy :D</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Brush Tools
        <ul>
          <li>These tools are the main things I used to draw the cherry blossoms on the front of the card. But with some reference
            images I was able to draw something I believe looks quite nice</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Mixer Brush
        <ul>
          <li>With this brush I made the wave effects on the card. I took colors that I used for the cherry blossoms and with many and I mean MANY attempts of mixing and drawing I was finally able to create a wave I liked</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Selection, Shape, and Mask tools
        <ul>
          <li>These tools allowed me to make the logo and the symbols on the back of the card. My drawing skills didn't come into play
            here and I instead found images online I liked. I then selected the part I wanted and hide the image so I'd have a blank
            selection made. With that done I created a shape underneath it and masked the selection so only the selected part would show.
            I'm sure there's an easier way to do this but I found it nice to only have to change the shape color if I wanted the color
            changed instead of having to use the fill bucket on every part</li>
