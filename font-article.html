  <h1>Types of Fonts</h1>
  <p>As I briefly explained on the definitions page, fonts are basically just a subset of a typeface. Any variation to a typeface is
    considered a font. There's many different subsets and I'll do my best to go through each one. The most common variations are...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular
        <ul>
            <li>This is pretty much just the basic form of the typeface</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bold</strong>
      <ul>
          <li>This change makes the typeface characters bulkier</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Italic</em>
    <ul>
        <li>When text is italicized it's given a slight slant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><strong>Bold Italic</strong></em>
    <ul>
        <li>When bold italic is used the characters get the effect of both so they'll be bulkier and have a slant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changing the Size
    <ul>
        <li>Pretty self explainatory but it's just when you change the size of the text</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>
  <p>There are some more uncommon subsets like thin, medium, semi-bold, ultra italic and etc that allow you more versatility when you wanna
    put a bold or italicize effect on your text. But the one that most people don't know about is the condensed or wide variation. This
    variation is really just changing the tracking for the characters but some fonts will have the changes already made for you. I'm sure
    there's many font variations and names I missed due to the hundreds and likely thousands of different fonts out there but I hope this
    article helped you understand how typefaces can easily be changed and new fonts can be made</p>

  <aside>
  <p>To those who don't know and even those who do while Photoshop and Word or whatever editor you're using can have many fonts and
    typefaces to choose from sometimes you just can't find one that really fits. Luckily there are many websites that have lots of fonts
    to pick from. A couple sites I found that have many different kinds ranging from elegant and pretty to fun and eccentric to even
    being a little more niche are the webpages for <a href="https://www.creativefabrica.com/fonts/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=Fonts_ww_pt_subscriptions_tcpa%3D33_search-new&utm_term=download%20fonts&gclid=&utm_reftag=&msclkid=c38978b745d61e8278a71f7352852868&utm_content=download%20fonts_en_broad" target="newtab">Creative Fabrica</a>
    and <a href="https://www.1001freefonts.com/" target="newtab">1001 Free Fonts</a> Much of their catalouges consists of paid for fonts
    but if you're a bit tight on cash they also have a nice stock of free ones as well so explore and find the right one for you :D</p>
