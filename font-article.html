  <h5 class="passionate">Types of Fonts</h5>
  <p class="left">As I briefly explained on the definitions page, fonts are basically just a subset of a typeface. Any variation to a typeface is
    considered a font. There's many different subsets and I'll do my best to go through each one. The most common variations are...</p>
    <img src="images/typography-pics/century-schoolbook.png" class="schoolbook" alt="Century Schoolbook Variations">
  <ul>
    <li>Regular
        <ul>
            <li>This is pretty much just the basic form of the typeface</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bold</strong>
      <ul>
          <li>This change makes the typeface characters bulkier</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Italic</em>
    <ul>
        <li>When text is italicized it's given a slight slant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><strong>Bold Italic</strong></em>
    <ul>
        <li>When bold italic is used the characters get the effect of both so they'll be bulkier and have a slant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changing the Size
    <ul>
        <li>Pretty self explainatory but it's just when you change the size of the text</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  <img src="images/typography-pics/mala.png" class="mala" alt="Different Mala Fonts">
  <p>There are some more uncommon subsets like thin, medium, semi-bold, ultra italic and etc that allow you more versatility when you wanna
    put a bold or italicize effect on your text. But the one that most people don't know about is the condensed or wide variation. This
    variation is really just changing the tracking (or spacing) between each of the letters but with these variations it's already done for you.
    I'm sure there's many font variations and names I missed due to the hundreds and likely thousands of different fonts out there but I hope this
    article helped you understand how typefaces can easily be changed and new fonts can be made.</p>

  <aside>
  <p>Now to those who don't know (and even those who do!) while Photoshop and Word or whatever editor you're using can have many fonts and
    typefaces to choose from sometimes you just can't find one that really fits. Luckily there are many websites that have lots of fonts to pick
    from. A couple sites I found that have many different kinds ranging from elegant and pretty to fun and eccentric to even being a little more
    niche are the webpages for <a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="newtab">DaFont</a> and <a href="https://www.fontspace.com/" target="newtab">Font Space</a>
    I've added a few that I liked from each site below. Much of their catalouges consists of paid for fonts but if you're a bit tight on cash they
    also have a nice stock of free ones as well so explore and find the right one for you :D</p>
