    This is where I keep all the projects I've worked on. I'm still quite the novice when it comes to Animate, Photoshop, and web
    development so there's been a lot of struggling with deciding what I wanna do and then changing my mind and scraping it all, of
    things not going how I wanted and having to adjust, and just figuring out and remembering how to use certain tools. But with the
    struggle also came a lot of success. So I hope you'll check out all my works and give any helpful feedback to help me grow in
    this industry. Take your time looking around and I hope you enjoy!
