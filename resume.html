        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <h4>Cook - Seaworld San Antonio</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up the kitchen and prepped certain products in morning to be sure things could run smoothly and customers wouldn't
                be waiting long for their food</li>
            <li>Ran and kept the kitchen clean when I was the only cook on site</li>
            <li>Stayed calm and got my job done while working on the busier days in an already fast paced enviroment</li>
            <li>Kept the enviroment clean and organized in occordance to the safety guidelines and to not lose important equipment</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Register - Seaworld San Antonio</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Talked to many customers daily by answering their questions, giving directions, or helping in whatever way I was able</li>
            <li>Would often run the store by myself on the slower days so would have to manage keeping the food stocked, taking orders,
                and checking out customers all at once</li>
            <li>Worked long hours on the days we were short staffed</li>
